# LDAV Web Instructions

This archive (and this readme file in particular) provides suggested
instructions for maintaining and updating the LDAV Symposium web pages. The
LDAV web pages are currently being hosted by GitHub pages, so modifying web
pages is done by updating files in the respective GitHub repositories.

Starting with the initial preparations for LDAV, beginning soon after the
previous year's symposium, the general procedure is as follows.

  1. [Create a new web page](#create-a-new-web-page)
  2. [Rotate in new page](#rotate-in-new-page)
  3. [Update page](#update-page)
